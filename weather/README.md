# wttr-switcher
Tiny widget for [wttr.in](https://wttr.in) service to change location dynamically

## Customization
Simply modify `weatherOptions` and `weatherImgAlt` in `main.js` according to [wttr help page](https://wttr.in/:help) to fit your needs

## (Optional) dependencies
For demo purposes and visual beautification I've only included

* Bootstrap 4 for CSS (container, responsive image, input-group and few helper classes)

## Browser support
All major browsers, should work all the way down to at least IE10 (untested)
